To analyze games with Cryptoverif, download Cryptoverif at https://bblanche.gitlabpages.inria.fr/CryptoVerif/ and then run your command console as:

```
cryptoverif.exe path_to_the_game.ocv
```

If you want to add library use argument ```-lib library.ocvl``` but remember to add the default library as ```-lib default.ocvl```, it is located in the main folder you download.
